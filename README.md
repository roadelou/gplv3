# GPLv3

A C tool to build GPLv3 LICENSE file automatically.

To install gplv3, clone this repository and then run `sudo make install`.
To use it, just run `gplv3`.

Essentially, gplv3 stores a copy of the GPLv3 License in
/etc/roadelou\_gplv3/GPLv3\_LICENSE, and running the executable roughly amounts
to calling `cp /etc/roadelou_gplv3/GPLv3_LICENSE LICENSE`.
